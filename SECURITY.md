# Security Policy

## Reporting security problems to Quarry Protocol

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please send an
email to team@quarry.so and provide your GitHub username so we can add you
to a new draft security advisory for further discussion.

Expect a response as fast as possible, typically within 72 hours.
